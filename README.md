# PeacefulHills

This is an old project of mine that I developed to learn how to write multiplayer code on ECS. In that project, I implemented a small modular network engine that supports RPC messages (see [PeacefulHills.Network](https://github.com/HelpOrMe/PeacefulHills/tree/main/PeacefulHills/Assets/Scripts/PeacefulHills.Network/Runtime), [PeacefulHills.Network.Messages](https://github.com/HelpOrMe/PeacefulHills/tree/main/PeacefulHills/Assets/Scripts/PeacefulHills.Network.Messages)). After that I had to implement the ECS, bootstrap because at that time Unity did not have one (probably not even now). In the end, I wrote [this article](https://habr.com/en/articles/593487/) (written in Russian) and abandon the project.
